# BFS with Vis.js

## Prompt

```
Generate a simulation of breadth-first-search on a graph. 
For this simulation, use a canvas that is 800 wide and 600 high. The background is aliceblue.
There are three buttons at the bottom of the canvas labeled Next, Previous, Solve and Reset.
On start or reset, generate 30 nodes and place them at random location on the 800x600 canvas with a border of 30.
Draw each of the nodes a circle of size 20. 
Connect each node with and edge to the 2 or 3 closest nodes using edges. 
For each step in the search, color the next vertex red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, pink and then gray.
Repeat until all vertices have been visited.
When all nodes have been visited display Status: Search Complete in {step} steps.
