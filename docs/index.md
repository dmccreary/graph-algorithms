# Graph Algorithms Course

![](./img/cover.webp){ width="500" }

Welcome to our new graph algorithms course.  In this
course, we will learn about the various algorithms
that are used to solve business problems using
graph networks.  We also discuss how machine learning
and graph embeddings are used to complement deterministic
algorithms.

This course leverages generative
AI to create interactive simulations of how these
algorithms work.  We give you sample prompts
and code to allow you to use generative AI 
to quickly customize our animations, even if you
are not familiar with the graph animation libraries.
