# AI-Assisted Graph Algorithms

![](./img/cover.webp){ width="500" }

Welcome to our new AI-assisted graph algorithms course.  In this
course, we will use AI to help us learn about the various algorithms
that are used to solve business problems using
graph networks.  We also discuss how machine learning
and graph embeddings are used to complement deterministic
graph algorithms.

This course leverages generative AI to create interactive
simulations of how these
algorithms work.  We give you sample prompts
and code templates to allow you to use generative AI 
to quickly customize our animations, even if you
are not familiar with the graph animation libraries.
