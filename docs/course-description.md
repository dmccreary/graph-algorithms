# Graph Algorithms Course Description


**Course Title:** Learning Graph Algorithms with AI

## Course Description

This 10-week course is designed for college students eager to learn how graph algorithms can be applied to solve real-world business problems. A distinctive feature of this course is its integration of generative AI tools, enabling students to generate code, create visualizations, and experiment with algorithms in real time.

## Prerequisites

Students should have a foundational understanding of data structures and databases. Access to a web browser and a software development environment capable of running Python code is required. While familiarity with Python and JavaScript is beneficial, it is not mandatory.

## Course Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

1.  **Remember**: Define key graph components (nodes, edges, properties) and basic graph types (e.g., directed, undirected, acyclic, concept graphs).
2.  **Understand**: Explain and compare the RDF and LPG data models, discussing their relative strengths and weaknesses.
3.  **Apply**: Use generative AI tools to generate graph data and algorithms for real-world business scenarios.
4.  **Analyze**: Distinguish between various types of graph algorithms (e.g., depth-first search, clustering, page rank, similarity, centrality), and identify their use cases.
5.  **Evaluate**: Assess the suitability of different graph algorithms for specific business problems and justify algorithm choices.
6.  **Create**: Develop and refine custom graph algorithms using browser-based libraries like D3.js and vis.js, incorporating generative AI for assistance.

### Additional Skills:

-   Utilize generative AI prompts to accelerate learning and enhance algorithm creation.
-   Visualize complex graphs in web environments for better comprehension and presentation.
