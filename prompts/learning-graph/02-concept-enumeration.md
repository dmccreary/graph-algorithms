# Concept Enumeration

Very nice. Next use this course description of a course on graph algorithms I will be teaching at a college or university. Please generate a list of the 150 core concepts that need to be covered in this course in the order in which they should be taught. Return numbered list of these core concepts using a single line per concept. For each concept, just return a short concept name and use acronyms or abbreviations when appropriate. They will be used as labels in a graph network. Make sure that the concepts are distinct not duplicated in the list. Start with the most basic foundational concepts and then proceed to the most complex concepts.
